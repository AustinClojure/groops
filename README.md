groops
======

This project will implement a Clojure version of the [Groops](https://github.com/groops/examples) application for the [Bleeding Edge Web](http://www.meetup.com/bleeding-edge-web/) meetup.  There are [loose specifications](https://github.com/groops/examples/wiki/Application-Specs) for the app, but we are free to implement that however we see fit. 

Keeping with the spirit of living on the Bleeding edge, the plan is to implement this using the "Immutable Stack" (coined by [Kitchen Table Coders](https://twitter.com/ktcoders)):

* Datomic
* Clojure
* ClojureScript
* Om
